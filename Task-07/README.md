The task was really challenging , I was able to complete the task Partially (except -b and -h commands)

**My approach is as follows:**
 I started by extracting the IMDb ID from a movie name or URL. Then, I scraped OpenSubtitles using the IMDb ID with optional filters like language and file size. After displaying a list of available subtitles, the user selects one, and the tool downloads and extracts the chosen subtitle into the specified output directory.
