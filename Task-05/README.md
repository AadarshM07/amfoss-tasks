The task was really interesting. Previously, I covered the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through an Udemy course by Dr. Angelina Yu.

It was time-consuming, but it turned out well.
I started with the HTML template provided in the asset folder, then moved on to the CSS part. I extracted the necessary elements from the Fakestore API and worked on the terminal commands. JavaScript was the area where I initially struggled, but I learned and caught up as I progressed.
