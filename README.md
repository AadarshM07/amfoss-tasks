# amfoss-tasks

## *INTRODUCTION*

Myself, Aadarsh Mahesh K, I am a first-year BTech Electronics and Computer undergrad at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri campus. I know beginner-level coding and my preferred language is Python. I am really enthusiastic about Blockchain. Believe me, even though I may not be able to explain what it is and how it works, I believe there is something in there, and I want to explore the field. Apart from that, my outdoor hobbies include going to the gym and playing basketball.

## *Why should we choose you?*

I believe in commitment, consistency, and discipline. During the Praveshan tasks, I’ve done my best to post updates regularly and stay on top of my work. I’m eager to learn and adapt to new technologies. My passion for exploring new ideas keeps me motivated and always learning. I’m confident I can be a valuable asset to the club, and I’m ready to put in the hard hours with pleasure.

## *How do you intend to contribute back to the club?*

## *What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?*

My field of interest lies in both electronics and computers, which explains why I ended up in my BTech branch. When it comes to computers, my interest lies in Python, web development, and blockchain technology. I want to deep dive into blockchain technology and learn more about it. I’m also interested in integrating blockchain with FOSS projects. I don’t know how appealing this seems because I don’t know much about blockchain yet, but I am eager to grasp its knowledge. Additionally, my field of interest includes joining the AM@FOSS club because it’s the only club I want to join so badly. On a different note, I also want to achieve a better physique over time and am committed to working for it.
