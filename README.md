## *INTRODUCTION*

Myself, Aadarsh Mahesh K, I am a first-year BTech Electronics and Computer undergrad at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri campus. I know beginner-level coding and my preferred language is Python. My hobbies inclube playing basketball and hitting the gym ,Also i am really commited on putting the hardwork and give my best on every work i take on.
## *Why should we choose you?*

I believe in commitment, consistency, and discipline. During the Praveshan tasks, I’ve done my best to post updates regularly and stay on top of my work. I’m eager to learn and adapt to new technologies. My passion for exploring new ideas keeps me motivated and always learning. I’m confident I can be a valuable asset to the club, and I’m ready to put in the hard hours with pleasure.

## *How do you intend to contribute back to the club?*
I will actively participate in discussions, activities, and events hosted by the club. I can assure you that I will not be the person who leaves after a month, realizing the amount of work required. I am willing to put in the hard work and dedicate the hours, as I believe that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction – the universe will reward you. Also, my passion for technology drives me to enter various competitions, and I will use these opportunities to represent and promote the club, AM@FOSS.

## *What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?*

My field of interest lies in both electronics and computers, which explains why I ended up in my BTech branch. When it comes to computers, my interest lies in Python, web development, and blockchain technology. I want to deep dive into blockchain technology and learn more about it. I’m also interested in integrating blockchain with FOSS projects. I don’t know how appealing this seems because I don’t know much about blockchain yet, but I am eager to grasp its knowledge. Additionally, my field of interest includes joining the AM@FOSS club because it’s the only club I want to join so badly. On a different note, I also want to achieve a better physique over time and am committed to working for it.
