I studied the neccessary module OpenCv and PIL from the documentations,also reffered youtube to know how the code structure works. 

I started by understanding grayscale conversion and contour detection with OpenCV, then learned about file handling and sorting in Python. For the task, I applied these concepts to process, sort, and merge images, ensuring accurate color and position tracking in the final result.
