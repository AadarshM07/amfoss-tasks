**PART-1**

As a newcomer to terminal commands, I used cd and ls to navigate to 'Eolian Caves/Entrance3/01' and successfully found the first code. And I also discovered another code in 'Statue of Marika.txt'.

**PART-2**

I became a bit frustrated. I used the git command to navigate to the Light Realm. While searching there, I found enough resources. Thanks to the grep command, I was able to search for file names containing 'holy' and 'good' and discovered common file names:"Moonbloom' and 'Mistveil',using that i formed the Holy spell.
