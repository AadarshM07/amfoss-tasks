**PART-1**

As a newcomer to terminal commands, I used cd and ls to navigate to 'Eolian Caves/Entrance3/01' and successfully found the first code. And I also discovered another code in 'Statue of Marika.txt'.

**PART-2**

I became a bit frustrated. I used the git command to navigate to the Light Realm. While searching there, I found enough resources. Thanks to the grep command, I was able to search for file names containing 'holy' and 'good' and discovered common file names:"Moonbloom' and 'Mistveil',using that i formed the Holy spell.

**PART-3**

In the third part, I used the git checkout command to switch between branches 'The-Dark-Realm-I' and 'The-Dark-Realm-II' and discovered Four codes there.It was really time consuming.

**PART-4**

After spending a considerable amount of time, I decoded the codes and  found the gosuite repo : https://github.com/amansxcalibur/Terminal-Chaos-Godsuite


**PART-5**

Compareively this part gone smooth and after long search  found : https://github.com/angrezichatterbox/To-the-stars-and-realms-unseen ,Then cloned the repo and runned victory.py.
THE AMOUNT OF SATISFACTION I GOT CANNOT BE EXPLAINED
